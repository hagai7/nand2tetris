nand2tetris is a project that aims to build a basic computer from the level of its logic gates to the level of the compiler.
The files in this repository include my implementation for this assignment and include main code files, test files, output files and comparison files.
The programs are written in Python and Assembly.
The stages of building the computer (according to the number of folders):
01 - Boolean Logic
02 - Boolean Arithmetic
03 - Sequential Logic
04 - Machine Language
05 - Computer Architecture
06 - Assembler
07 - Virtual Machine (Arithmetic)
08 - Virtual Machine, Continued (Control)
10 - Compilation
11 - Compilation, Continued (Code Generation)
12 - Operating System
